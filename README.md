## Project Overview  
Computer vision is the art of teaching a machine to "see." This project trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify German road signs from the [GTSRB dataset](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_news.html).  

The workflow includes:  
- Data preprocessing and augmentation  
- Model building with CNNs  
- Training, validation, and testing  
- Performance evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and misclassification review  
- Insights on strengths, weaknesses, and possible applications for real-world traffic systems  

## Features  
- End-to-end CNN pipeline for image classification  
- Image preprocessing and augmentation for robustness  
- Visualization of training and validation accuracy/loss  
- Confusion matrix to assess model performance  
 - Misclassification histogram to visualize error patterns 
- Example predictions with correct/incorrect classifications  
- Executive-style summary of model outcomes  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Dataset:** German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)  

## Usage  
To explore the project:  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Open and run the notebook `./notebooks/model_analysis.ipynb` for model building and evaluation  
3. To generate or customize the figures for the executive summary, run `./notebooks/executive_summary_visuals.ipynb`
4. See final results and conclusions published to the web [here](https://johbry17.github.io/Red-Light-Green-Light/).

![Class Distribution Plot](./resources/images/class_distribution.png)
*Class imbalance: Label distribution is highly skewed across classes.*  

![GTSRB Sample Images](./resources/images/GTSRB_representatives.png)
*Dataset diversity: representative image for each label.*  

![Training Curve Comparison](./resources/images/training_curves_comparison.png)
*Validation and training curves: best model vs. baseline.*  

![Confusion Matrix Comparison](./resources/images/confusion_matrix_comparison.png)
*Confusion matrices: best model noticeably reduces off-diagonal errors.*  

![Misclassifications](./resources/images/misclassifications_baseline.png)
*Frequent errors: visually similar signs are misclassified.*  

![Error Confidence Histogram](./resources/images/confidence_histogram_comparison.png)
*Histogram: overkill modelâ€™s errors are less confident and more frequent.*  

## Certificate  

Completed during the course of HarvardX's [CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/).  The project began as a simple assignment and grew into a portfolio piece.
